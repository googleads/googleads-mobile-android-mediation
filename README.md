Google Mobile Ads SDK - Android Mediation
=========================================
The Google Mobile Ads SDK is the latest generation in Google mobile advertising,
and features refined ad formats and streamlined APIs for access to mobile ad
networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to
maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.

This repository is broken into two sections:

## Mediation Example

A sample project demonstrating how an ad network can plug into AdMob Mediation.
The project contains a "Sample Ad Network" SDK library, as well as a sample
mediation adapter and custom event implementation for AdMob Mediation capable of
loading banners, interstitials, rewarded video, and native ads.

A test application is also included, and uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK to call
into the adapter and custom event to test their implementations. It can be used
during development to test new adapters and custom events, once ad units have
been set up.

## Mediation Adapters

Open source adapters for mediating the following networks via the Google Mobile
Ads SDK:

* AdColony
* Chartboost
* Facebook Audience Network
